## 2.a)
``` java
public class Car {
    private final Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        engine = new Engine();
    }
}

class Engine {
}

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
public class Team {
    private List players;

    public Team() {
        players = new ArrayList();
    }
}

class Player {
}

```
### i. What is the relationship between class Car and class Engine? (2 points)
-   Composition
### ii. What is the relationship between class Team and class Player? (2 points)
-   Aggregation
### iii. Draw the UML class diagram for the given code. 
***Note: I forgot the constructors in the UML ðŸ™‚ðŸ’”***

## 2.b) 
Consider this UML class diagram showing part of a program to manage the membership information for a
professional society:
### i. Write a Java version of class ManagementCttee assuming it has this constructor: (6 points)
public ManagementCttee()
``` java
class ManagementCttee{
    private ArrayList<SeniorMember> seniorMembers;
    public ManagementCttee() {
        seniorMembers = new ArrayList<SeniorMember>();
    }

    public void addCtteeMember(SeniorMember s){
        seniorMembers.add(s);
    }

    public void removeCtteeMember(String name){
        for (int i = 0; i < seniorMembers.size(); i++){
            if (seniorMembers.get(i).getName().equals(name)){
                seniorMembers.remove(i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### ii. Class Member is an abstract class. Explain the role of an abstract class. (3 points)
- Abstract class is used to provide common method implementation to all the subclasses or to provide default implementation.
### iii. Write a Java version of class StandardMember assuming it has this constructor:
public StandardMember(String name, String address)
and the standard membership fee is fixed at L.E. 50. (6 points)
``` java
class StandardMember extends Member{

    public StandardMember(String name, String address){
        super(name, address);
    }
    @Override
    public int getFee() {
        return 50;
    }
}
```
