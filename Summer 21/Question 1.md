</br>

### 3) (True/False) Static fields are be accessed  *only* by the class name.
### - False. it can be accessed through an instance of the class also.
</br>

### - False. Inheritance
</br>

### 5) Why "@Override" is used before the definition of a function?

| :----------: | :----------: |
| The compiled byte code of Test class in Test.java | The byte code of the anonymous inner class in Test class and the number "1" indicates the order the anonymous inner class in the code |

### 10) Why inner classes are used?
